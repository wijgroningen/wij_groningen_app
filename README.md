# Introduction

Many organisation decide to buy standerdized software because developing and maintaining something this themselves is expensive and very often organisation lack the required programming skills.
The result is that in many cases the software is nog optimized for the goal it is trying to achieve. Preferably software is written specifically for the customer, in this case the application user.

ChatGPT could make a difference here. 

This application is the result of an attempt to create a full fledge application using ChatGPT. So, instead of programming everything myself, i asked Chatgpt to generate the code. 
Does this make development time short?<br>
Can anyone do this? So is programming experience even required?<br>
